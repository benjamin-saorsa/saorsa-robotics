# Ops notes

- Put cloud infra (Terraform) here if desired. Minimal requirements: one Linux GPU VM with public or VPN‑reachable TCP ports for Policy and Rewarder.
- For on‑prem, consider NVIDIA AI Enterprise/vGPU for multi‑user sharing.
- Data: co‑locate datasets with the GPU server to avoid egress costs.
